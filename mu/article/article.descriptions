Fixing Velocity:
3D:  Angle and energy range of plot, evaluation of Eq & structure.
     Onset and gap.
     Zone of energy & angle where the intense respones is mantained.
RTP: Decomposition of response in components.
     Similar or mayor contribution of components.
     Values of components at maximum angle and energy.
     Resulting value and angles for maximum responses.
     Maintenance or change in spin polarization.
     Layer decomposition.
