Since its discovery, graphene has attracted a great interest in materials
science and condensed matter physics being a new class of materials that are
only one atom thick\cite{geimNM07}. This allotrope of carbon with hexagonal
lattice structure is almost transparent and presents properties like fractional
quantum Hall effect at room temperature, excellent thermal transport properties,
high conductivity and strength.\cite{geimNM07, reinaNL08, novoselov2S07,
balandinNL08} Graphene has a metallic band structure but the band gap can be
opened by applying uniaxial strain \cite{niACSN08}, changing the surface
area\cite{hanPRL07} or applying an electric field \cite{zhangN09}. Another option to open the gap is by doping the structure with

\subsection{Pure spin velocity} % (fold)
\label{sec:theory-pure_spin_current}


The spin density injection current $\dot{K}^{\mathrm{ab}}(\omega)$, 
% 
{
\color{red}
where the
roman superscripts denote Cartesian components corresponding $\mathrm{a}$ to the
spin velocity direction and $\mathrm{b}$ to the spin polarization direction, can
be written in terms of a material response pseudotensor
$\mu^{\mathrm{abcd}}(\omega)$ as
}
\begin{equation*}
\dot{K}^{\mathrm{ab}}(\omega) = \mu^{\mathrm{abcd}}(\omega)
E^{\mathrm{c}}(\omega) E^{\mathrm{d*}}(\omega)
\label{eq:dotk}
\end{equation*}
where the pseudotensor is given by\cite{bhatPRL05}
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
\mu^{\mathrm{abcd}} (\omega) 
&=
\frac{\pi e^{2}}{\hbar^{2}} \int 
\frac{d^{3}K}{8 \pi^{3}}
\sum_{vcc'}^{'}
\mathrm{Re} \left[ K^{\mathrm{ab}}_{cc'} 
\left( 
r^{\mathrm{c}}_{vc'} 
r^{\mathrm{d}}_{cv } +
(c \leftrightarrow d)
\right) 
\right]
\delta(\omega-\omega_{cv})
\label{eq:mu}
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
{\color{red}
where $K^{\mathrm{ab}}_{mn}(\mathbf{k}) =
\sum_{\ell}v^{\mathrm{a}}_{nl}(\mathbf{k}) S^{\mathrm{b}}_{lm}(\mathbf{k})$ are
the spin current matrix elements that, using time reversal invariance, satisfy
the relation $K^{\mathrm{ab}}_{nm}(\mathbf{-k}) = K^{\mathrm{ab*}}(\mathbf{k})
$. 
}% 
The $'$ in the sum means that $c$ and $c'$ are quasi degenerate states and
the sum only covers these states and 
{\color{red}
since $\mu$ is real we have that
$\mu^{\mathrm{abcd}}(\omega) = \mu^{\mathrm{abdc}}(\omega)$.
}
Now we define the spin velocity, $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ab}}(\omega,\alpha)$ as
the speed at which the spin polarized in the $\mathrm{b}$   direction moves
along the $\mathrm{a}$ direction when a normal incident beam reaches the $xy$
plane with a polarization angle $\alpha$ as
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ab}}(\omega,\alpha)
&= \frac{2}{\hbar}
\frac{\mu^{\mathrm{abxx}}(\omega)
E^{2}(\omega)\cos^{2}(\alpha) + 
\mu^{\mathrm{abyy}}(\omega)
E^{2}(\omega)\sin^{2}(\alpha) + 
2\mu^{\mathrm{abxy}}(\omega)
E^{2}(\omega)\cos(\alpha)\sin(\alpha)}
{\xi^{\mathrm{xx}}(\omega)
E^{2}(\omega)\cos^{2}(\alpha) + 
\xi^{\mathrm{yy}}(\omega)
E^{2}(\omega)\sin^{2}(\alpha)},
\nonumber \\
&= \frac{2}{\hbar}
\frac{\mu^{\mathrm{abxx}}(\omega)\cos^{2}(\alpha) + 
\mu^{\mathrm{abyy}}(\omega)\sin^{2}(\alpha) + 
\mu^{\mathrm{abxy}}(\omega)\sin(2\alpha)}
{\xi^{\mathrm{xx}}(\omega)\cos^{2}(\alpha) + 
\xi^{\mathrm{yy}}(\omega)\sin^{2}(\alpha)},
\label{eq:vab}
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
{\color{red}
where $\xi^{\mathrm{aa}}(\omega)$ are the carrier generation rate tensor
components\cite{arzatePRB14}.
}
% 
For an angle $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{4}$ this expression can be reduced to 
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:vab-90deg}
\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ab}} (\omega)
= \frac{2}{\hbar}
\frac{\mu^{\mathrm{abxx}}(\omega) + \mu^{\mathrm{abyy}}(\omega) + 
2\mu^{\mathrm{abxy}}(\omega)}
{\xi^{\mathrm{xx}}(\omega) + \xi^{\mathrm{yy}}(\omega)}.
\end{equation*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Fixing spin}\label{sec:theory-fixspin}

{\color{red} Considering that we have 2D structures, one of the options to
analyze the spin velocity (Eq. \eqref{eq:vab}) is fixing the spin parallel to
the surface of the structure in the $x$ or $y$ directions or perpendicularly to
it in the $z$ direction. We define the magnitude of the spin velocity with spin
polarization along the $\mathrm{b}$ Cartesian coordinate as}
\begin{align}
|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{b}}}(\omega,\alpha)| 
&=
\sqrt{
[\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ax}}(\omega,\alpha)]^{2}\ +
[\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ay}}(\omega,\alpha)]^{2}\ 
}, 
\label{eq:vs-mag}
\end{align}
and the angle at which the spin velocity is directed on the $xy$ plane as
\begin{align}
\gamma_{\mathrm{b}} (\omega,\alpha)
&=
\tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ay}}(\omega,\alpha)}
{\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ax}}(\omega,\alpha)} \right),
\label{eq:gamma-ang}
\end{align}
where the angle is measured in the counter-clockwise direction from the positive
$x$ Cartesian coordinate. 
{\color{red}
We also define two special angles
\begin{align}
\gamma_{\mathrm{b \parallel}}(\omega,\alpha) &= \alpha, 
\label{eq:gamma-par} 
\\
\gamma_{\mathrm{b \perp}}(\omega,\alpha) &= \alpha \pm 90^{\circ}.
\label{eq:gamma-perp}
\end{align}
The first corresponds to the case when the spin velocity is directed, on the
$xy$ plane in the same direction of the polarization angle of the incoming beam;
the second one corresponds to the case when the spin velocity is directed
perpendicularly respect to the polarization angle of the incoming beam.

\subsection{Fixing velocity.}\label{sec:theory-fixvel}

{\color{red} Another possibility to analyze the Eq. \eqref{eq:vab} is fixing the velocity on
the $xy$ plane along $x$ or $y$ Cartesian coordinate and then define the
magnitude of the spin velocity directed along the $\mathrm{a}$ direction as}
\begin{align}
|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}}&(\omega,\alpha)| = \nonumber \\
&\sqrt { 
[\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ax}}(\omega,\alpha)]^{2} +
[\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ay}}(\omega,\alpha)]^{2} +
[\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{az}}(\omega,\alpha)]^{2} .
},
\label{eq:vv-mag}
\end{align}
{\color{red} Then, the spin direction depends of the $x$, $y$, and $z$
components of the previous equation and so we define the spin orientation polar
and azimuthal angles as}
\begin{align}
\theta_{\mathrm{a}}  (\omega,\alpha)
=& 
\cos^{-1} \left( \frac{\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{az}}(\omega,\alpha)}
{|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)|} \right),
& 0 \leq &\theta \leq \pi, 
\label{eq:polar-ang}
\\
\varphi_{\mathrm{a}} (\omega,\alpha)
=& 
\tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ay}}(\omega,\alpha)}
{\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ax}}(\omega,\alpha)} \right),
& 0 \leq &\varphi \leq 2\pi.
\label{eq:azimuthal-ang} 
\end{align}
{\color{red} where $\theta_{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)$ is measured from the
positive to the negative $z$ Cartesian coordinate and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)$ is measured on the $xy$ plane in the
counter-clockwise direction from the positive $x$ Cartesian coordinate.}

\subsection{Layer-by-layer analysis.}\label{sec:theory-layer}

For a layered system we have that the total contribution of Eqns. 
\eqref{eq:vs-mag} and \eqref{eq:vv-mag} is given \cite{arzatePRB14} by 

\begin{align}
|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{b}}}(\omega,\alpha)|
=& 
\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}
\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_{\mathrm{eff}}}
|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{b}}} (\ell | \omega,\alpha)|
\label{eq:vs-layer}
\\
|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)|
=&
\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}
\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_{\mathrm{eff}}}
|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}} (\ell | \omega,\alpha)|

We preset the results for $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ and
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{b}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ for the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt
and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures being both noncentrosymmetric semi-infinite 2D
carbon systems with 50\% hydrogenation in different arrangements. The \emph{up}
structure has hydrogen atoms only on the upper side of the carbon sheet while
the \emph{alt} structure has alternating hydrogen atoms on the upper and bottom
sides. We take the hexagonal carbon lattice to be on the $xy$ plane for both
structures, and the carbon-hydrogen bonds on the perpendicular $xz$ plane, as
depicted in Figs. \ref{fig:alt-struc} and \ref{fig:up-struc}
% 
{\color{blue} and the coordinates for the \emph{up} and \emph{alt} unit cells of
the structures are presented in Tables \ref{tab:up-unitcell} and
% 
\ref{tab:alt-unitcell}. In same tables we present the layer division needed to
calculate the layer-by-layer contribution for the
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{b}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ and
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ presented in Eqns. 
% 
\eqref{eq:vs-layer} and \eqref{eq:vv-layer}. The \emph{up} structure was divided
in two layers, the first comprised of the top hydrogen atoms denoted by the
number 1 in Table \ref{tab:up-unitcell} and in the Fig. \ref{fig:up-struc} and
the second comprised of carbon atoms and denoted by the number 2. The \emph{alt}
structure was divided in six layers denoted with numbers from 1 to 6 in Table
\ref{tab:alt-unitcell} and in Fig. \ref{fig:alt-struc}. The first and sixth
layers correspond to hydrogen atoms in the top and bottom positions and from the
second to the fifth correspond to carbon atoms placed in different positions.}

{\color{red} We calculated the self-consistent ground state and the Kohn-Sham
states using density functional theory in the local density approximation (DFT-
LDA) with a planewave basis using the ABINIT code \cite{gonzeCPC09}.}
% 
We used Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH) relativistic separable dual-space
Gaussian pseudopotentials \cite{hartwigsenPRB98} including the spin-orbit
interaction needed to calculate $\mu^{\mathrm{abcd}}(\omega,\alpha)$ presented
in Eq.
\eqref{eq:mu}.
% 
The convergence parameters for the calculations of our results corresponding to
the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures are cutoff energies of 65\,Ha and
40\,Ha, respectively. The energy eigenvalues and matrix elements for the
\emph{up} ad \emph{alt} structures were calculated using 14452 $\mathbf{k}$
points and 8452 $\mathbf{k}$ points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ)
{\color{red} resulting in LDA energy band gaps of 0.72\,eV and 0.088\,eV,
respectively.
% 
We notice that within DFT, the LDA is only one of other possible methods that
can be used to determine the electronic structure of materials. Recent
investigations on graphene show some of the differences in calculated values
from several of these methods\cite{karamanisJPCC15,botelloACR14}. We note that
the LDA is as good as these other approaches. It is also known that the DFT
calculations predict a band gap for the material that differs from experiment.
This can be corrected using other \emph{ab initio} techniques, such as the GW
approximation\cite{onidaRMP02}, but this calculation has a very high
computational cost and is out of the scope in this paper. Even so, DFT still
remains as an effective and useful tool for computing diverse properties derived
from the electronic band structure.}

{\color{red}Using the Eq. \eqref{eq:vab}, we calculated the
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{ab}}(\omega,\alpha)$ response for the \emph{up} and
\emph{alt} 2D structures and for the CdSe and GaAs bulk systems; the results
are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:vab-str-comp}. The angle $\alpha$ presented in
the response of each structure is that for which the response is maximized in
each case.}
% 
From the figure we have that the onset of the response starts when the energy of
the incoming beam is the same of the gap energy.
% 
The most intense response corresponds to the \emph{up} structure centered at
0.088\,eV corresponding to the {\color{red} Mid Infrared (MIR)} radiation and
reaching a spin velocity of 87.2\,Km/s.
% 
In the other hand, for an energy range from 0.66\,eV to 3.0\,eV, corresponding
to energies of the {\color{red} Near Infrared (NIR) to visible radiation}, all the four
structures have contributions in the same order of magnitude.
% 
For this energy range the \emph{up} structure has two peaks centered at 1.94\,eV
and 1.97\,eV reaching spin velocities of 22.2\,Km/s and -29.7\,Km/s,
respectively, and the \emph{alt} structure has two peaks centered at 0.72\,eV
and 0.91\,eV reaching spin velocities of -40.2\,Km/s and -32.9\,Km/s,
respectively.
% 
Then, for the bulk structures we have that the CdSe has only one intense
response centered at 0.91\,eV reaching a spin velocity of -26.9\,Km/s, and the
GaAs structure has a large and almost planar zone where the response is held
reaching the maximum for an incoming beam of energy of 2.31\,eV and resulting in
a spin velocity of -21.6\,Km/s.
% 
{\color{red} A negative quantity in the spin velocity means a change in the spin
polarization traveling in the opposite direction.
% 
In table \ref{tab:vab-str-comp} we present the comparison of this values for the
2D and bulk structures. We found that the most intense response for the spin
velocity corresponds to the \emph{up} structure being 3.25 times more intense
than that of the CdSe and 4.03 times more intense than that of the GaAs bulk
structures. Also, the \emph{alt} structure has a response more intense than the
bulk systems but being less intense than the corresponding to the \emph{up}
one.}

{\color{red} Using the Eq. \eqref{eq:vs-mag}, we calculated the
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{b}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ response and made the
analysis for the case when the spin is fixed in the $z$ coordinate, directed
perpendicularly to the surface of the \emph{up} and \emph{alt} structures. Also,
using the Eq. \eqref{eq:gamma-ang}, we determined the angle
$\gamma_{\mathrm{b}}(\omega,\alpha)$ where the spin-velocity is directed on the
surface of the each structure.}
% 

\textbf{Up structure}

We first analyzed two energy ranges in Fig. \ref{fig:up-3d-vsz} for the
\emph{up} structure, the first for an incoming energy beam from 0.0\,eV to
0.2\,eV (top panel)  which include the THz and the Mid Infrared (MIR) radiation,
where the absolute maximum of the
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ response is obtained, and
the second for an energy range from 1.80\,eV to 2.1\,eV (bottom panel),
corresponding to visible radiation, where two local maxima are found.
% 
Making the analysis, we obtained that the zone where the maximum response is
held corresponds to a energy range of the incident beam from 0.084\,eV to
0.093\,eV and polarization angles $\alpha$ between $30^{\circ}$ and
$45^{\circ}$. Also the two local maxima are held for same beam polarization
angles but for an energy range between 1.90\,eV and 2.05\,eV.
In the top frames of top and bottom panels of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vaz-rag} we
present in solid lines the result of evaluate
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$, related to the left scale,
fixing the energy of the incoming beam to 0.088\,eV and 1.972\,eV, respectively,
values for which the response is maximized for the \emph{up} structure. In the
same panels and frames we present in dashed lines, related to the right scale,

the bottom frames of the panels we present the corresponding components
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ and

square boxes indicating the values where the angles of the spin velocity are

From top panels of Figs. \ref{fig:up-3d-vsz} and \ref{fig:up-vaz-rag} we have
that the absolute maximum response for the \emph{up} structure is obtained for
an incoming beam with energy of 0.088\,eV and polarization angle
$\alpha=40^{\circ}$ resulting in a value of
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=95.8$\,Km/s coming from the
contribution of the components
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)=39.8$\,Km/s and
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)=87.2$\,Km/s for the spin polarized in
the $\mathrm{z}$ direction and having a velocity angle
$\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}(\omega,\alpha)=65^{\circ}$ on the first Cartesian quadrant
of the $xy$ plane.
% 
{\color{red} From the top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vaz-rag} we have that the
velocity angle is almost constant for all the polarization angle range having
values of $\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}(\omega,\alpha) = 65.5^{\circ} \pm 0.5^{\circ}$.
In this panel the green circled box indicates the value for which the
polarization angle and the response direction angle are collinear corresponding
to $\gamma_{\mathrm{z}\parallel}(\omega,\alpha) = 65.5^{\circ}$ and resulting in
a value of the response of $|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)| =
82.3$\,Km/s indicated by the upward green arrow.
% 
Also the blue square box indicates the value for which the polarization angle
and the response angle are perpendicular being $\alpha=155.5^{\circ}$ and
$\gamma_{\mathrm{z}\perp}(\omega,\alpha)=65.5^{\circ}$; for this angle the
response has a value of $|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)| =
24.8$\,Km/s indicated by the blue downward arrow.}
% 
Now, from bottom panels of Figs. \ref{fig:up-3d-vsz} and \ref{fig:up-vaz-rag} we
have that the most intense local maximum of the response is obtained for an
incoming beam with energy of 1.972\,eV and same polarization angle
$\alpha=40^{\circ}$ resulting in a value of
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=30.3$\,Km/s. This comes from
a major contribution of the $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ component
being directed in a velocity angle $\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}(\omega,\alpha) =
78^{\circ}$ on the first Cartesian Quadrant on the $xy$ plane.
% 
{\color{red} Again from the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vaz-rag} we found
that the velocity angle is almost constant at $78^{\circ}$ and has variations of
$1^{\circ}$ for polarization angles $0^{\circ} \leq \alpha \leq 100^{\circ}$. In
this range the green circled box indicates the value for which the polarization
angle and the response direction angle are collinear corresponding to
$\gamma_{\mathrm{z}\parallel}(\omega,\alpha) = 78.5^{\circ}$ and having a
response value of $|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)| =
23.5$\,Km/s indicated with the green upward arrow.
% 
Finally, the blue square box indicates the value for which the polarization
angle and the response angle are perpendicular being $\alpha=168.5^{\circ}$
$\gamma_{\mathrm{z}\perp}(\omega,\alpha) = 78.5^{\circ}$ and having a response
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=9.0$\,Km/s indicated with
the blue upward arrow.}
% 
We also made the analysis for the cases when the spin polarization is directed
along the $\mathrm{x}$ and $\mathrm{y}$ Cartesian coordinates but we do not
present here the corresponding plots. For those cases we have that the absolute
maxima responses are obtained for an energy of the incoming beam equal to
0.088\,eV and polarization angle $\alpha=40^{\circ}$ resulting in values of
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{x}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=37.4$\,Km/s and
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{y}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=24.8$\,Km/s.

\textbf{Alt structure}

In Fig. \ref{fig:alt-3d-vsb} we analyzed the energy range for the incident beam
from 0.6\,eV to 1.0\,eV, corresponding to the NIR radiation, where the absolute
maximum of $|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ response is
obtained for the \emph{alt} structure .
% From this figure we found that the zone where the absolute maximum response is
% held corresponds to a energy range from 0.90\,eV to 0.93\,eV and polarization
% angles $\alpha$ between $120^{\circ}$ and $150^{\circ}$. Also, a local maximum

% and 0.75\,eV.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
{\color{red} From Figs. \ref{fig:alt-3d-vsb} and \ref{fig:alt-vaz-rag} we have
that the absolute maximum response is obtained for an incoming beam with
polarization angle $\alpha=145^{\circ}$ reaching a velocity of
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 43.0$\,Km/s for the spin
polarized in the $\mathrm{z}$ direction and resulting in a velocity angle
$\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}(\omega,\alpha)=50^{\circ}$ on the first Cartesian Quadrant
of the $xy$ plane.
% 
Also, from the top frame of Fig. \ref{fig:alt-vaz-rag} we found that the
velocity angle is centered at $51.5^{\circ}$ having variations of $\pm
2^{\circ}$ for the polarization angle range $0^{\circ} \leq
\alpha \leq 180^{\circ}$.
% 
As made in the previous analysis the circled box indicates the collinear angle
(Eq. \eqref{eq:gamma-par}) $\gamma_{\mathrm{z}\parallel}(\omega,\alpha) =
53.5^{\circ}$ corresponding a value of
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 12.7$\,Km/s; the blue
square box indicates the perpendicular angles corresponding values
$\alpha=140^{\circ}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{z}\perp}(\omega,\alpha)=50^{\circ}$
with a value of $|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=43$\,Km/s.}
% 
Again, for the cases in which the spin polarization is parallel to the surface
of the \emph{alt} structure was calculated but the plots are not presented here.
The absolute maxima for the cases when the spin polarization are directed in the
$\mathrm{x}$ and $\mathrm{y}$ direction are obtained for an energy of the
incoming beam equal to 0.912\,eV and polarization angle $\alpha=145^{\circ}$
resulting in values of
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{x}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=27.1$\,Km/s and
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{y}}}(\omega,\alpha)|=33.2$\,Km/s.

% %% 1.8 eV - 2.0 eV
% %% Description of UP |V^{a}|, components and RTP
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
From the top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vab-comp-rtp-1} we have that for an
incoming bean with energy of 0.088\,eV the three components have similar
contributions with values of
% 
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xx}}(\omega,\alpha)=-36.5$\,Km/s,
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xy}}(\omega,\alpha)=-23.2$\,Km/s, and
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)= 39.8$\,Km/s resulting in a response
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)|=58.7$\,Km/s being this value the
absolute maximum obtained when the spin-velocity is fixed in the $x$ direction.
% 
{\color{red} To this value corresponds polar and azimuthal spin polarization
angles of $\theta_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)=47$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)=212$, respectively, being directed upward
the third Cartesian quadrant of the $xy$ plane.
% 
Also from this figure we have that those angles values are held for almost all
the peak of the response having variations of $\pm 2^{\circ}$ each one.
% 
Now, from the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vab-comp-rtp-1} we have that the
components have contributions of
% 
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yx}}(\omega,\alpha)= -7.9$\,Km/s 
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yy}}(\omega,\alpha)=  8.6$\,Km/s, and
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)= 87.2$\,Km/s 
% 
resulting in a response $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)|=87.9$\,Km/s.
This value is the absolute maximum obtained when the spin-velocity is fixed in
the $\mathrm{y}$ direction and is 1.5 times more intense than the maximum of
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ for this structure. To this absolute
maximum corresponds spin polarization polar and azimuthal angles
$\theta_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 8^{\circ}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 133^{\circ}$ being directed the spin
almost perpendicularly over the $xy$ plane and  localized on the first Cartesian
quadrant.}
% 
In a different way than in the $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ case
for the $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ only the polar angle is held
at $8^{\circ}$ for the peak of the response having variations of $\pm 2^{\circ}$
but the azimuthal angle changes from $99^{\circ}$ to $176^{\circ}$ having a
value of $133^{\circ}$ for the maximum.
% 
We also found that since the onset of the response till an energy for the
incoming beam of 0.118\,eV the components of both responses, have no change in
the spin polarization-velocity direction. Finally, after this last energy value
the responses go to zero.
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Also there is another energy range of interest for an incoming energy beam from
1.80\,eV to 2.10\,eV, corresponding to visible radiation, presented in Fig.
\ref{fig:up-3d-vva-2} where two local of both responses are obtained for the
\emph{up} structure for energies of 1.934\,eV and 1.972\,eV
fixing again the polarization angle to $40^{\circ}$.
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %% Starting description of UP |V^{x}|, components and RTP
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\color{red} We found that for both cases the components have similar contributions for each
response and for 1.934\,eV result in values of
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 6.6$\,Km/s for the spin velocity
moving along the $x$ direction with polar and azimuthal spin polarization angles
$\theta_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)= 42^{\circ}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)=59^{\circ}$ being the spin directed over
the first Cartesian quadrant of the $xy$ plane;
% 
for the spin moving along the $\mathrm{y}$ direction we have a response
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)|=28.7$\,Km/s with polar and azimuthal
spin polarization angles $\theta_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)=45^{\circ}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)=56^{\circ}$ being  the spin directed over
the first Cartesian quadrant of the $xy$ plane.
% 
Alike, for an incoming energy beam of 1.972\,eV we found the second and more
intense local maxima for which all the components have similar contributions for
both responses.
% 
This result in values of $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 9.9$\,Km/s
and $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 49.4$\,Km/s with spin
polarization angles $\theta_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha) = 129^{\circ}$,
$\varphi_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)=229^{\circ}$,
$\theta_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 127^{\circ}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)=227^{\circ}$ being the spin directed
downward the third Cartesian quadrant of the $xy$ plane when it moves in the $x$
direction and downward the third Cartesian quadrant when it moves along the $y$
direction.}
% 
Also all the components of the responses keep the spin polarization positive
till an energy of the incoming beam equal to 1.954\,eV when the spin
polarization and current changes the direction. After an energy of 2.05\,eV both
responses goes to zero.

{\color{red} For the \emph{alt} structure we analyzed the energy range from
0.6\,eV to 1.0\,eV in Fig. \ref{fig:alt-3d-vva}, corresponding to the NIR
radiation, where we found a local maxima and the most intense responses for
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ and
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{a}}(\omega,\alpha)|$.}
%
From this figure we can see that for the zone between the energy range of
0.90\,eV-0.93\,eV and polarization angles between 120$^{\circ}$ and
150$^{\circ}$ is the zone where the maximum for both responses is held.
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %% Starting description of ALT |V^{a}|, components and RTP
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the top frames of top and bottom panels of Fig. \ref{fig:alt-vab-comp-rtp} we
present the spectra of $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ and
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ fixing the polarization angle to
$\alpha=145^{\circ}$ for which the response is maximized and its corresponding
polar and azimuthal angles; in the bottom frames of same panels we present the
corresponding three components $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xx}}(\omega,\alpha)$,
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xy}}(\omega,\alpha)$,
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)$,
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yx}}(\omega,\alpha)$,
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yy}}(\omega,\alpha)$ and
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)$.
% 
{\color{red} Making the analysis when the energy of the incoming beam is
0.720\,eV we have similar contributions from the components when the sping
velocity is along the $x$ diection and a major contribution from
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ when the spin velocity is dierected
alog $y$ Cartesian axis. This result in values of
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 19.4$\,Km/s and
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 51.9$\,Km/s with spin polarization
angles $\theta_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha) = 46^{\circ}$,
$\varphi_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha) = 41^{\circ}$,
$\theta_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 141^{\circ}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 222^{\circ}$ being the spin polarization
directed over the first Cartesian quadrant of the $xy$ plane when the spin
velocity is directed along $x$ and directed downward the third Cartesian
quadrant when the spin velocity is directed along $y$.
% 
Then, for an energy of 0.912\,eV we have values of
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha)|=30.9$\,Km/s and
$|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha)| = 52.3$\,Km/s. The first of them have
a major contribution from the $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)$
component and the second one having similar contributions from all of three
components. They result in polar and azimuthal angles
$\theta_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha) = 154^{\circ}$,
$\varphi_{\mathrm{x}}(\omega,\alpha) = 290^{\circ}$,
$\theta_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 129^{\circ}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{y}}(\omega,\alpha) = 229^{\circ}$ being the spin polarization
directed downward the fourth Cartesian quadrant of the $xy$ plane when the spin
velocity is directed along $x$ and downward the third Cartesian quadrant of the
$xy$ plane when the spin velocity is directed along $y$.}
% 
Finally we have that the three components of $|\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{y}}|$ are
negative keeping the same spin polarization and velocity direction since the
onset of the response to a energy of the incoming beam of 0.886\,eV when the
response decreases and goes to zero.

From the central and bottom frames of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vsz-lay-1} we have that
when the energy is fixed to 0.088\,eV almost all the response of the
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ component comes from the second layer
comprised by carbon atoms having a minimal reduction produced by the hydrogen
layer. Also, the $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ response, presented
in bottom frame of same figure, is produced only by the carbon layer. This
result in a total response $|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)| =
95.8$\,Km/s coming from the carbon layer and being minimally reduced by the
hydrogen layer as shown in the top frame of this figure.
% 
Now, for the same structure but now fixing the energy to 1.972\,eV we have from
the central frame of Fig. \ref{fig:up-vsz-lay-2} that the the carbon layer
produces the response of the $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{zx}}(\omega,\alpha)$
component being decreased by the hydrogen layer. Opposite to that, in the bottom
frame of same figure we obtained that the response of the carbon and hydrogen
layer are not inverse and then contributing both to the total response of
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)$. Then, in the top frame of this
figure we have that the major contribution to the
$|\mathcal{V}_{\sigma^{\mathrm{z}}}(\omega,\alpha)|$ comes from the carbon layer
with but being in this case reinforced by the contribution of the hydrogen layer
and resulting in a value of 30.3\,Km/s}

{\color{blue}
Finally, for the \emph{alt} structure we have that the six layers contribute
with similar magnitudes and reinforce the
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ and
$\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{yz}}(\omega,\alpha)$ components resulting in a total
response $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{xz}}(\omega,\alpha) = 43$\,Km/s.
